      "content": "### A Historical Perspective: From Post-Independence to Liberalization\n\nFollowing its independence in 1947, India adopted a socialist-inspired economic model, characterized by central planning, state ownership of key industries, and protectionist policies. The 'License Raj' era, while aimed at self-sufficiency, often led to inefficiencies and limited growth. The watershed moment came in 1991 with the New Economic Policy (NEP), driven by a balance of payments crisis. This policy ushered in an era of liberalization, privatization, and globalization (LPG), dismantling many of the old controls and opening up the economy to foreign investment and competition."

The services sector, particularly IT and business process outsourcing (BPO), emerged as a major growth engine, leveraging India's large, English-speaking talent pool. The manufacturing sector also saw growth, albeit at a slower pace, with government initiatives like 'Make in India' aiming to boost domestic production and exports. India consistently ranks among the fastest-growing major economies, driven by domestic consumption, a growing middle class, and increasing integration into the global economy."
