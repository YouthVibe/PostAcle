      "content": "The cornerstone of any budget-friendly fitness plan is leveraging the most powerful tool you already own: your body. Bodyweight exercises are free, can be done anywhere, and are incredibly effective for building strength and endurance. Start by mastering the fundamentals: Push-ups for chest and arm strength, Squats for powerful legs and glutes, Lunges for balance and lower body toning, Planks for a rock-solid core, and Jumping Jacks for a quick cardio burst. These exercises form a versatile foundation that you can build upon as you get stronger."

These items are a one-time purchase that will pay for themselves many times over in workout variety."

Principle: Frequency (How often you work out - aim for 3-5 days a week), Intensity (How hard you push yourself), Time (How long each session is - 20-45 minutes is a great start), and Type (What kind of exercises you do). To help you get started, here is a sample weekly plan:"
