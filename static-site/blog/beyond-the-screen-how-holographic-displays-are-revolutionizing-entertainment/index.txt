Many large-scale 'holograms,' like those seen in concerts, utilize a 19th-century technique called 'Pepper's Ghost,' which reflects a 2D image off a transparent screen. While effective, it's not a true 3D hologram. True holographic displays reconstruct a light field, which is the collection of all light rays flowing through every point in a space. When your eyes intercept this reconstructed light field, you perceive a 3D object with perfect depth cues and parallax, as if it were physically present.
