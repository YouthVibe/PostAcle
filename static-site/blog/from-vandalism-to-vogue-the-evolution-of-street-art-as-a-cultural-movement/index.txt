This was the birth of graffiti culture, a competitive and highly stylistic art form centered on getting one's name seen. For many disenfranchised youths, it was a way to claim space and create an identity in a city that often overlooked them.

Basquiat's raw, expressive, and poetically charged works brought the frantic energy of the streets into the high-concept gallery space.

Shepard Fairey's OBEY Giant campaign and his iconic 'Hope' poster for Barack Obama showed the immense power of street art to influence mainstream culture and politics. This era also saw a dramatic diversification of techniques and scale. Beyond spray paint, artists began using stencils, wheatpaste posters, stickers, and even large-scale photographic installations, like those by the French artist JR.

It stands as a powerful testament to art's ability to reclaim and redefine historical spaces. Today, cities across the continent are hotspots for the movement. Lisbon actively encourages street art, with programs that commission artists to beautify derelict buildings, resulting in a vibrant, city-wide gallery. In Bristol, Banksy's hometown, his works are protected landmarks. Meanwhile, artists like Italy's Blu create enormous, elaborate murals that critique capitalism and conflict, and France's Invader playfully 'invades' cities across the globe with his pixelated mosaic creations.
