Key methods include traditional soil-based container gardening, hydroponics (growing plants in nutrient-rich water), aquaponics (a symbiotic system involving fish and plants), and aeroponics (growing plants with their roots suspended in the air).

Urban farms also create green spaces that help mitigate the 'urban heat island' effect, where concrete and asphalt make cities warmer than surrounding rural areas. Plants cool the air through evapotranspiration and provide shade.
