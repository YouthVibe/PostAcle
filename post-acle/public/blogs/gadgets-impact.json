        "content": "# Gadgets and Student Performance\nIn 2003, the Department of Education (DepEd) issued Order No. 83, which strictly prohibited the use of cellphones by students while in class. This order applied to both public and private schools, reinforcing previous departmental orders. The goal of the ban was to reduce distractions and keep students focused on their studies."

While gadgets can aid learning, excessive use often leads to distractions and reduced performance. Experimental studies indicate that banning phones in schools boosts academic results, especially for low-performing students who are more prone to distractions."

While phones themselves arenâ€™t the real problem, misuse in classrooms causes distractions. The no-cellphone policy is a smart move to keep students attentive and engaged. Allowing unrestricted phone use could lead to cheating, social issues, and illegal activity. On the other hand, phones do have safety benefits. Thus, balancing usage policies while educating students about responsible use is the key to leveraging technology in education."
