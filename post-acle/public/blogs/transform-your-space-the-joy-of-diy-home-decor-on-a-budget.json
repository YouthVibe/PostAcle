Create a mood board to define your style. Next, set a realistic budget. DIY is about being savvy with your spending.

You can fill them with anything from fabric swatches and wallpaper samples to your own simple abstract paintings. Furniture makeovers are another game-changer. A bold coat of paint can completely transform an old, dated side table into a modern statement piece. Don't underestimate the power of new hardware \u2013 swapping out old knobs for new, stylish ones is a quick and impactful update that takes mere minutes."

It's best to start with a small, manageable project to build your confidence before tackling something larger. Most importantly, have fun with the process! Put on some music, perhaps pour a glass of wine, and enjoy the simple, meditative act of creating something beautiful with your own hands."
