        "content": "## My First Experience\nWhen I first used AI (ChatGPT), I was amazed by its coding skills. But I quickly realized it sucked at handling large, complex projects. Then came the agentic coders, agentic IDEs, and new models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4 Sonnet, which revolutionized vibe coding."

It never worked well.\n2. **Single Chat Syndrome**: I worked on an entire project in a single AI chat. That ruined accuracy.\n3. **Lack of Prompt Detailing**: I didn’t describe what I wanted clearly.\n4. **No Feature Breakdown**: I didn't break the project into parts.\n\n### What I Learned:\n- Always break your project into tasks and features.\n- Start a new chat for each task.\n- Be detailed and explicit with your instructions.\n- Think like a project manager, not a magic wand user."

It’s powerful if used right."
