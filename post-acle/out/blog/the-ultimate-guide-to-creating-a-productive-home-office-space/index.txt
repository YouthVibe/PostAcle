Look for one with adjustable height, armrests, and robust lumbar support. Your feet should rest flat on the floor, and your knees should be at a 90-degree angle. Next, your desk. A standard desk height is around 73-75 cm, but the ideal height depends on your chair and your body. Adjustable sit-stand desks are an excellent option, allowing you to alternate between sitting and standing throughout the day.

Position your desk to maximize natural light, which is proven to boost mood and reduce eye fatigue. However, avoid placing your monitor directly in front of or behind a window to prevent glare. Supplement natural light with a good desk lamp that provides focused task lighting.

The most important, and often most chaotic, element to tackle is cable management. Use cable ties, sleeves, or a cable management box to tame the spaghetti monster of wires under your desk.
