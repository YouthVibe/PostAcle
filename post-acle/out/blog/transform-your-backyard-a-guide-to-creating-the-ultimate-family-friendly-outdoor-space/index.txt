A truly family-friendly space is a safe one. Start by assessing your yard for potential hazards. Secure the perimeter with a sturdy fence and a locking gate to keep little ones from wandering off. Underneath any play equipment, opt for soft landing materials like rubber mulch, wood chips, or well-maintained grass instead of hard dirt or concrete.
