For decades, industries have grappled with this challenge, evolving their maintenance strategies from reactive 'fix-it-when-it-breaks' approaches to scheduled, preventive measures. However, the true paradigm shift is happening now, driven by the potent combination of Industrial IoT (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence.

The next step was 'Condition-Based Maintenance' (CBM), which uses sensor data to trigger alerts when predefined thresholds are breached. AI-powered Predictive Maintenance (PdM) represents the apex of this evolution.
