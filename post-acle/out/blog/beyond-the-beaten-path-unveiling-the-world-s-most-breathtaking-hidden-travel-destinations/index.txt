Unlike its popular neighbor, Iceland, the Faroe Islands remain relatively untouched by mass tourism. Here, you can hike to the breathtaking 'floating lake' of S√∏rv√°gsvatn, watch thousands of puffins take flight from the cliffs of Mykines, and experience the unique Faroese culture, a rich blend of Norse heritage and modern creativity.

While political instability in mainland Yemen has made access challenging, dedicated tour operators still facilitate safe trips for the truly adventurous.
