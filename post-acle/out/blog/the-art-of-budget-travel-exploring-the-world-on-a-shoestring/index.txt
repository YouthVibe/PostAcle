Within India, destinations like Hampi, Rishikesh, or the Spiti Valley offer breathtaking experiences without the hefty price tag. Once you've chosen a place, tackle the biggest expense: flights. Use flight comparison websites like Skyscanner or Google Flights, always browse in incognito mode to avoid price hikes, and set up fare alerts. Being flexible with your travel dates by even a day or two can sometimes cut your airfare in half. When it comes to accommodation, move beyond conventional hotels. Hostels are a fantastic way to meet fellow travelers and save money. Platforms like Hostelworld and Booking.com make finding them easy.

Always carry a reusable water bottle to refill instead of constantly buying new ones. To get around, embrace public transportation. It‚Äôs cheaper and gives you a real feel for the local way of life. For longer distances, overnight trains or buses are a brilliant hack‚Äîthey combine your transport and accommodation costs for one night.
